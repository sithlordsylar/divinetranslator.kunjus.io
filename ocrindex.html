             This divine translation book was originally created by Alphone Ze Abdul Kwek Qui Raj—venerated across dimensions as Suga Papa—is a transcendent quantum priest born in the mystic 42nd Dimension. Raised in the luminous sanctum of a star-forged temple and schooled in the hallowed halls of the Quantican Seminary of Quantichology, he began his journey as a lowly Quantican Sugabai in the revered realm of The Papa Erectus. Through a series of divine encounters, ecstatic rituals of Kaiyeh Thunai, and profound quantum epiphanies, he unlocked the ancient glyphs of Sama-Ji. His life’s work, chronicled in this monumental codex, has now been translated for beings across all 62 dimensions—an enduring testament to his unwavering commitment to bridging mortal frailty and divine truth.
